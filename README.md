## Features

### Custom Resolution Latent Node: <br>
This node is specifically designed for use with SD 3.5 (of course, you can use it with other models like Flux). Users can select an aspect ratio and a target size of either 1MP or 2MP, and the node will then determine the optimal resolution for compatibility with SD3 models.

### Style Selector <br>
This streamlined node leverages the A1111 Prompt Styler. While several nodes offer similar functionality, they typically require a find-and-replace node to parse the A1111 styles file. This node eliminates that requirement. Furthermore, it provides both positive and negative conditioning for enhanced control.<br>
In this node, the CLIP input is optional. If you connect the input CLIP, you get conditioning (+/-), and if not, you get only the positive and negative stylized prompt text output.

### Image Overlay: RGBA on RGB <br>
This node overlays a foreground image (RGBA or RGB) onto a background image (RGB), preserving transparency and allowing control over the foreground's opacity. The foreground image's alpha channel is used to blend it seamlessly with the background. If the foreground is RGB, an alpha channel is automatically added based on the specified opacity. The output can be either RGB or RGBA, depending on your needs.

Key Features:<br>
Supports both RGBA and RGB foreground images.
Adjustable foreground opacity (0.0 to 1.0).
Outputs in RGB or RGBA format.
Handles batch processing for multiple images.

Requirements:<br>
Both the foreground and background images must be the same size (height and width) for proper compositing.
Input tensors should be in the format (B, H, W, C), where:
B = Batch size
H = Height
W = Width
C = Channels (3 for RGB, 4 for RGBA)

### TextBehindImage Node: <br>
The TextBehindImage node is a specialized tool for creating layered compositions in ComfyUI, designed to place text or graphics between the subject and the background of an image. This node is perfect for scenarios where you want to insert text or design elements behind the main subject while keeping the subject prominently visible on top.
