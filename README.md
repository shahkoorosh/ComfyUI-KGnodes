# KGnodes

This Custom node offers various experimental nodes to make it easier to use ComfyUI.

## Features

Custom Resolution Latent Node: <br>
This node is specifically designed for use with SD 3.5 (of course, you can use it with other models like Flux). Users can select an aspect ratio and a target size of either 1MP or 2MP, and the node will then determine the optimal resolution for compatibility with SD3 models.

Style Selector: <br>
This streamlined node leverages the A1111 Prompt Styler. While several nodes offer similar functionality, they typically require a find-and-replace node to parse the A1111 styles file. This node eliminates that requirement. Furthermore, it provides both positive and negative conditioning for enhanced control.<br>
In this node, the CLIP input is optional. If you connect the input CLIP, you get conditioning (+/-), and if not, you get only the positive and negative stylized prompt text output.
